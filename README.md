# loop-controller-for-1-antenna
This is a variation of the former loop controller for 3 antennas this time with only 1 antenna. At the request of Lev OK2PLL.
He is making a small loop controller with an arduino nano and a pololu for portable operation.
The power supply is 5Vcc from the micro USB connector. It is enough for a portable operation with a portable mobile charger
